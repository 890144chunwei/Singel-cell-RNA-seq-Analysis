# Singel-cell-RNAseq-Analysis
The pipeline aims to streamline processing raw fastq files from 10X platfrom from accounting for batch effects, sequence alignment, clustering, cell type annotation, and downstream differential analysis, generating publication-ready plots. Most of the analyses are built on top of existing tools and/or packages publicly available. Please find the reference as indicated. Here, the pipeline demonstration consisits of two parts, QC and batch effect adjustment in Bash script (part I) and clustering annotation in R script (Part II):
